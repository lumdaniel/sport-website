    <h1>BASKETBALL</h1> 
    <h2><li>
        Basketball is a team sport where one team, usually consisting of five players, play against each other on a rectangular court.     </li></h2>
    <h2><li>
        The objective is to get the ball through a hoop mounted high on a backboard on the opponent's side of the court, while preventing the opponent from shooting it into your team's hoop    </li></h2>
 
 <h2><li>
    Basketball players mainly use skills such as dribbling, shooting, running, and jumping. Each made basket is worth two points, while a basket made from beyond the three-point line is worth three points.

    History
 </h1>
 

<h2 style="color: orange ;">
    In the early years the number of players on a team varied according to the number in the class and the size of the playing area. In 1894 teams began to play with five on a side when the playing area was less than 1,800 square feet (167.2 square meters); the number rose to seven when the gymnasium measured from 1,800 to 3,600 square feet (334.5 square meters) and up to nine when the playing area exceeded that. In 1895 the number was occasionally set at five by mutual consent; the rules stipulated five players two years later, and this number has remained ever since.
